# CustomizingGooglePlacePicker
Popup google place picker instead of present by default

## The story
I have a request to make GMSAutocompleteViewController in a popup not present as default in iOS, so I make it

## This is what it looks

## Some notes
- I manually add Google SDK. Why? Because Coapod is ugly

- You need change your API before using 

## Spec
- Swift 4.2

## End
Have fun!
